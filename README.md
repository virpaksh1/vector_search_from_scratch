# Vector Search from Scratch in C++

This is a simple implementation of **vector-based document similarity search** in C++ using basic 2D word embeddings. It demonstrates how to:

- Tokenize text
- Compute document vectors by averaging word embeddings
- Calculate cosine similarity between a query and documents
- Return top-K most similar results

## Concepts Used

- Tokenization using regular expressions
- Basic word embeddings (2D vectors)
- Sentence-to-vector conversion
- Cosine similarity
- Vector search ranking

## Features

- Easily extensible to use higher-dimensional or pre-trained word embeddings (e.g., GloVe, Word2Vec,or BERT)

- Can be adapted for vector-based search tasks or sentence similarity

## Future Improvements

- Replace hardcoded embeddings with real pre-trained embeddings

- Add support for more dimensions
