Machine learning is powerful
Artificial intelligence advances rapidly
Deep learning transforms technology
Data science drives innovation
Neural networks power AI
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field focused on creating machines that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed
Deep Learning, a branch of ML, uses neural networks with many layers to model complex patterns in large datasets
AI applications include speech recognition, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles
As data and computing power grow, AI and deep learning are becoming increasingly powerful and widely used
